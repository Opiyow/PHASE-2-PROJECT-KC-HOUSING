### PROBLEM STATEMENT
According to MaKe Realtors more houses are sitting on the market longer than previously observed, fewer people are buying homes and home prices in some areas are dropping. Clients are also backing out after viewing and inspecting units for sale. Could this be due to the condition of the units compared to the buying price quoted?
It is taking MaKe Realtors slightly longer to sell through all the homes for sale at current demand than it would have the previous months,pointing to a less frenzied market.
Sellers who correctly price their homes in today‚Äôs market get top-of-market prices. With this information MakE Realtors hope to optimize their pricing strategies based on the home features that potential home buyers deem crucial.
As the lead data scientist at MaKe, I have been tasked with creating an automated system to estimate the sale price of houses/homes, using information such as the house condition, square footage, number of bathrooms and bedrooms, waterfront and lot size. Estimates from the generated system will be used to predict the house sale prices by the real estate firm.
